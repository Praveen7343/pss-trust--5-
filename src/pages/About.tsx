              Potukuchi Somasundara Social Welfare and Charitable Trust (PSS Trust) is a registered Non-Governmental Organization (Reg No: 95/2003) established on August 15, 2003. Founded by Dr. (H.C) P. Srinivas in honor of his father, the late P. Somasundara Sastry—a distinguished recipient of the National Best Teacher Award from Andhra Pradesh—the Trust is dedicated to continuing his legacy of educational excellence and social service.

              Our primary focus is on children from families living below the poverty line, including children of migrant workers and daily wagers. These students often face significant socio-economic barriers that hinder their pursuit of secondary and higher education. Without timely intervention, these challenges lead to high dropout rates among boys and early marriages among girls, perpetuating a cycle of poverty. PSS Trust steps in to bridge these gaps, providing the necessary support and mentorship to ensure every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential.
            </p>

              Over the past two decades, PSS Trust has evolved into a beacon of hope for thousands of students. We don't just provide financial aid; we offer a comprehensive support system that includes counseling, skill development, and career guidance, ensuring our students are not just educated, but also employable and empowered. Our mission is to transform BPL families from beneficiaries of government subsidies into dignified, tax-paying citizens through quality education and sustainable employment.
